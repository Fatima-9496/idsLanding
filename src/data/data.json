  "About": {
    "paragraph": "An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a cybersecurity tool designed to monitor and secure computer systems and networks against unauthorized access and malicious activities. Operating in real-time, an IDS continuously analyzes network or system activities, generating alerts when it detects suspicious patterns. There are two primary types: Network-based IDS (NIDS), which monitors network traffic, and Host-based IDS (HIDS), which operates on individual systems. IDS uses signature-based detection, comparing activities against predefined patterns, or anomaly-based detection, identifying deviations from normal behavior. Integration with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems enhances threat detection and response, and regular updates ensure effectiveness against evolving cybersecurity threats."
